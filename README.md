# Regular Grammar to DFA Converter

This is a Shiny application developed in R that converts a regular grammar into its corresponding Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The app provides a graphical interface for users to input a regular grammar and visualize the resulting DFA using the iGraph library. It also includes syntax validation and error handling to ensure correct input processing.

## Features

- **Grammar Input**: Users can input their regular grammar using a text area in the application.
- **Graph Visualization**: The DFA is visualized as a graph using the `igraph` library.
- **Syntax Validation**: The app validates the input grammar for correctness.
- **Error Handling**: If the input is invalid, the app notifies the user and displays a placeholder graph.
- **Interactive Buttons**: 
  - `Click!` to process the grammar.
  - `Clear!` to reset the input and graph.
